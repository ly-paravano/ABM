## Data Insight 4

The tracking / storage of data is the only reason we have witnessed significant ability to describe, analyze and predict human development and behaviour. Nowadays, social media allows Data Scientists to easily collect accurate data on human populations to make extremely accurate agent based models.

A great example of data science being used to help the human condition can be seen with John Snow’s use of geospatial analysis to track the origin of a cholera outbreak. In the world of the 1850s, cholera was believed to be spread by miasma in the air, germs were not yet understood and the sudden and serious outbreak of cholera in London's Soho was a mystery. So Snow did something data journalists often do now: he mapped the cases, and was able to identify that the cause of the outbreak was a contaminated water well. Without the proper use of data collection, who knows the further damage the cholera outbreak of the 1850s would have on London.

The emergence of social media has allowed the collection of an individual’s data is significantly easier and will only lead to the improvement of agent based modeling. John Snow had to go household to household to collect his data, it was monotonous and static (if an individual died after their household was surveyed that data point would have not been included in John Snow’s map). In contrast, nowadays, you can very easily scrape major social media platforms to learn a person’s age, gender, city of residence, employment status, political opinions, etc. Data Scientists, like John Snow, are now starting to use data from social media platforms to better the human conditions. Sarah Wise’s academic paper Using Social Media Content to Inform Agent-based Models for Humanitarian Crisis Response describes how to utilize social media to optimize crisis responses times using the Colorado Wildfires in 2012 as a case study. Such an example highlights the potential benefit of the use of social media data. 

Additionally, as people become more comfortable with social media accessing their personal information, I can only assume agent based models will become significantly better. For example, Snapchat has a feature that tracks and displays your current location to all of your friends on the platform. Such a feature could significantly improve agent based models if Data Scientists had access to datasets on individuals daily movement. 

On the other hand, we do need to question the morality of agent based models built on social media. What data is too personal to exploit for the sake of sourcing a model? Personally, I would be horrified if I was made aware that a Data Scientist in XYZ country was tracking social media interactions I have with my friends, and that comes from someone fascinated by data. 

The resources are there, in my opinion, the morality of utilizing those resources is what is currently stopping agent based models from advancing to a next level of accuracy.
